# not-youtube

<ul>
  <li>Not-youtube is a thoughtful placeholder name given by me to the <i>task given</i> which is to make a video player application with playlist built-in, having features like drag and drop functionality to re-order playlist and autoplay support. It consists of a collection of publicly available and hosted sample videos for testing purpose.</li>
  <li>Not-youtube is a React.js application which uses Tailwind CSS for styling and React router for routing. The video player and playlist components have been built in-house. This includes even autoplay and reorder feature which have both been built in-house without the use of any external libraries.</li>
  <li>The hosted link can be found in the about section of this repo. It is <b>FULLY RESPONSIVE</b> for all screen sizes (reorder playlist currently supported on pc only) </li>
  <li>In order to run the project locally, just do the usual clone, install and start.</li>
  
</ul>
